# DEISI-World-Meter
This project is a Java application called “DEISI World Meter”.

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

```Data Manipulation:``` 
The application reads and analyzes data from various CSV files, which contain information about countries, cities and populations. Data is stored in multiple custom object lists.

```Data Validation:``` 
 Functions were implemented to validate data read from files. This includes checking whether a value is numeric, whether a country exists in the country list, and whether a country ID is valid.

```Object Orientation:``` 
 The project makes extensive use of classes and objects to represent entities such as countries, cities and populations. Additionally, polymorphism is used to return different types of objects based on an entity type parameter.
